    """An abstract base class for importers.

    When a subclass is instantiated, the source parameter can be an
    ElementTree.Element or a filename (string).
    
    If the log parameter is False, no logging is done.

    During init, this class calls get_element_tree() from this module.
    Callers should be prepared to handle the errors described there.

    Once instantiated, users should call the go() method to execute
    the import. 
    
    Subclasses of this class need to override the go() method. Subclasses 
    implementing go() must call post_import() at the end. 

    When go() is complete, the instance attributes are as follows:
      - found_count is the number of potential importables found
      - imported is a list of the objects imported

    In addition, if the import began at the root node of the XML file
    (which will be the case for most/all instances of this class instantiated
    outside of this module), the following attributes are also populated:
      - version holds the version string from the import file
      - timestamp is when the export was made
      - comment is the export comment
      - log_filename is the name of the file to which import messages were
        logged
