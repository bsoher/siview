Installation Instructions
=======================================

You'll need to use the command line for most of these instructions. If 
possible, we suggest that you copy and paste the commands in this guide 
to reduce the possibility of typos.

Step 1 - Install Python

  Washout uses 64-bit Python 3.9. We recommend using an automated Python 
  distribution called Miniconda. These instructions assume that you used 
  Miniconda to install 64-bit Python as described below.

  Install the 64-bit Python 3.9 for your system from here: 
  http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html

Step 2 - Install Washout's Dependencies

  Run this command --

    conda install numpy scipy matplotlib wxPython

  Then run this command --

    pip install nibabel pydicom
