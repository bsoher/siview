    # We have to deal with types in three contexts -- Python, XDR, and numpy.
    # They mostly overlap, but not entirely seamlessly. Here's some bumps to
    # be aware of --
    # - Python ints are only guaranteed to be at least 32 bits. On (some? all?)
    #   64-bit systems, numpy ints default to the numpy.int64 type. That means 
    #   that a numpy int can't safely be represented as a Python int. One has
    #   to resort to the rarely-used Python long type to safely represent a
    #   numpy.int64 in Python. The distinction between int and long disappears
    #   in Python 3 (where ints can represent arbitrarily large values, just 
    #   like longs in Python 2).
    #
    # - XDR supports 64-bit ints under the name "hyper".
    #
    # - Going in the other direction (Python long ==> numpy.int64 or hyper) is
    #   also an overflow risk since a Python long can contain an arbitrarily 
    #   large value. Fortunately we never deal with large int values.
    # 
    # - Python floats are "usually implemented using double in C" (per Python 
    #   2.7 doc on standard types) which means 64 bits. XDR and numpy both 
    #   support higher precision (128-bit) floats, calling them "quadruple"
    #   and "float128" respectively. Python's XDR module doesn't support writing
    #   128-bit floats (which makes sense, since Python's float can't represent
    #   them), so if numpy ever hands us a 128-bit float, we're in trouble.
    #
    # - XDR doesn't understand complex numbers. It's trivial to represent them
    #   into (real, imag) float pairs, but it's nevertheless something that 
    #   our code needs to (and does) handle.
